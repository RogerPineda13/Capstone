# Capstone Project
## Used and New Car Price Predictor
Wordsmith/Coder: Roger Pineda
## Overview
The project here has sought out to go and predict the price of used and new cars from a dataset that had over four hundred thousand car listings from craigslist with the use of a variety of regression algorithms. Many features of the car were used to attempt to accurately predict the price.
## Business Problem

## Data Understanding
The dataset is from Kaggle and it is currently over 1.5g of space and therefore too big to be pushed to GitHub. The link to the dataset will be at the bottom of this Read.ME
## Data Cleaning
The data started with four hundred thirty thousand car listings from craigslist and was saved in a 
## Modeling
For the modeling portion of this repo you have to go into the modeling note book to see all the work and coding that was needed to properly predict the price of any vehicle.
The modeling algorithms used were as follows
* Linear Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression
* XG Boost Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Neural Network Regression
## Deployment
An app that is currently only able to run locally has been created for users to go out and figuree out what their cars value is or what they could possibly buy a vehicle for.
All the required packages to run the app correctly are stored within the required folder in the main part of this repo. The app is stored in the app.py file.
